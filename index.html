            Hi There!
        </h1>
        <p>
            This site will be used to demonstrate the hosting of Sites using Netlify!
            This site will later on be used to deploy my personal portfolio.<br/>
            I have been working for Cognizant for 1 year as a Programmer Analyst Trainee(PAT).<br/>
            Checking if branching is working or not!<br/>
            Yup, branching is working just fine! Points to be noted :-<br/>
                1. Clone a Repository from GitHub<br/>
                2. Create different branches to work on different branches.<br/>
                3. Make changes to those branches and Commit them to current branch.<br/>
                4. Create a Pull Request to merge the Current changes branch to the main branch on GitHub.<br/>
                5. Merge Pull Request to main branch on GitHub and then Changes are Live in production.<br/>
                6. Fetch the changes that have been pushed to main branch on GitHub on your local Main branch.<br/>
